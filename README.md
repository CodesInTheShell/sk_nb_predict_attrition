# sk_nb_predict_attrition
Sample implementation of sklearn naive bayes algorithm to predict employee attrition based on attrition data set. 

The code also sampled how saving and loading of model and labelencoders so that it can be use for future prediction without the need of re-training the model.

This project is a great reference for developing a new categorical classification with sklearn.
